-- Exercise01: Determine the number of employees in the Sales department. Also create a proper header that shows the information appropriately.

GROUP BY e.department_id;
-- returned 11 rows with counts 

-- Exercise03: Determine the number of employees each manager will manage from the employees table.

GROUP BY e.manager_id; 
-- returned 10 rows with counts


-- Exercise04: Determine who (if anyone) has two children from the dependents table.

        d.dependent_id
FROM dependents d 
INNER JOIN employees e ON d.employee_id = e.employee_id

HAVING totalDependents > 1;

SELECT *, 
        IS NULL(COUNT(e.employee_id), 0) AS 'Dependents'
CROSS JOIN dependents d
LEFT OUTER JOIN  employees e ON d.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id, d.dependent_id;


SELECT COUNT(employee_id) as totalDependents,
        dependent_id
FROM dependents
GROUP BY dependent_id
HAVING totalDependents > 0;
-- this returns 


-- cant get it
